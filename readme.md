# English Football Statistics Data & Scripts

This project is to gather and clean English football historic data to be able to use within other apps I am building.

Currently (as of 10/2025) I have most of the English 1st & 2nd Division parsed and cleaned, along with the scripts to make it repeatable. Current WIP is the more modern Premier League Era, 2000-present (need to update scripts for these years)

## Structure of Project

- `data` - this is data I have gatered from outside sources, it is not considered clean and needs processed
- `data-output` - processed data, may still need cleaning, but has been processed and/or generated from scripts
- `scripts` - general dumping ground of misc scripts for generating/cleaning data
- `wikipedia` - All scripts for wikipedia data scraping & generation

```bash
pnpm i

```
